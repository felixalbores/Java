Dependency Injection Principles says this Report class should not worry
creating the calculator object  and using it are different concerns
annd we need to separate them, this is what we called the separation of concerns

-We use inteface for injecting the constructor, try too look out the constructor
-Dependency Injection is really helpful, because your class is independent of each other.
-It indepedent of each other, if you modify the class, then then the other class would not be affected.

-If one class may be broken, then the other class would not be affected 
 just like using Constructor Injection.

-To achieve this we need to use interface

-This is based on my understanding only.
